The previous post describes using LLMs to generate technical prose. That writing serves a very concrete goal: to build systems that stand the test of time. Many times though, I would like to write to achieve a very different goal: capture my own thoughts and ideas. LLMs cannot achieve that.


As a reader, I appreciate knowing that there is an individual thinking deeply behind each of the ideas and words that are presented. It is an intentional act that enables connecting with the material and the author's perspective. It further enables filling in the gaps knowing the context that the author lives in. This is something an LLM or any generated content misses out on.

In the past, technology has seemingly devalued sought after skills. For example, the invention of the photograph had similar criticisms regarding the lack of authenticity or talent required to produce art. However, nowadays, we have learnt that a camera can be just as effective as a painting to capture a moment.

 The distinction, as always, is purpose. LLMs empower us to express ideas, but cultivating genuine connection with an audience remains the creator's responsibility.
